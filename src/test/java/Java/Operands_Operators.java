 * : Multiplication         ||  ++ : Increments by 1            ||  == Equal to                 ||      && -> And -> True if both true  ||  += , Add  and assign.
 / : Division               ||  -- : Decrements by 1            ||  != Not Equal to             ||      || -> Or ->True if one is true  ||  -= , Subtract  and assign.
